2. The player guesses letters of the word one by one.
3. If the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed in the word's correct positions.
4. If the guessed letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman is drawn.
5. The player continues guessing letters until they guess the entire word or run out of attempts.
6. If the player guesses the word correctly, they win. If they run out of attempts before guessing the word, they lose.
